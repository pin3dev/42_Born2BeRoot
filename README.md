# Born2BeRoot
<h3>Create virtual machine without GUI &amp;&amp; Configure via bash.</h3>

- 🎯 This project aims to *create a virtual machine with no graphical interface* and followed by the configuration of various system parameters provided in the subject [Born2BeRoot_subject.en](https://github.com/pin3dev/Born2BeRoot/blob/main/Born2BeRoot_subject.en.pdf).

- 💚💛 The guide is in Portuguese-Brazil, because I believe there is still little specific material on the subject in this language, and can be accessed by [clicking here](https://pin3dev.gitbook.io/projetos/).
