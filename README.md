<!-- # Born2BeRoot

- üéØ This project aims to *create a virtual machine with no graphical interface* and followed by the configuration of various system parameters provided in the subject [Born2BeRoot_subject.en](https://github.com/pin3dev/Born2BeRoot/blob/main/Born2BeRoot_subject.en.pdf).
- üìö Besides the practical character, for the effective conclusion of the project, we were *required to have theoretical knowledge about all the tools used in its development*.
- ü§ì The project was all developed in *VirtualBox*, and through its development I had access to some **new knowledge/skills** described below:
