# Born2BeRoot
<h3>Create virtual machine without GUI &amp;&amp; Configure via bash.</h3>

- 🎯 This project aims to *create a virtual machine with no graphical interface* and followed by the configuration of various system parameters provided in the subject [Born2BeRoot_subject.en](https://github.com/pin3dev/Born2BeRoot/blob/main/Born2BeRoot_subject.en.pdf).
- 📚 Besides the practical character, for the effective conclusion of the project, we were *required to have theoretical knowledge about all the tools used in its development*.
- 🤓 The project was all developed in *VirtualBox*, and through its development I had access to some **new knowledge/skills** described below:
<p> ➡️ Concept and practice on virtual machines | Operating system | Package manager | System security | Password policy | Partitioning | LVM | Firewalls | SSH | Script and Cron | Bash commands | etc...
<br>
  
- 🖖 To support my studies, I made a guide with all the necessary theoretical background for those who are starting the project, as well as links to more detailed material, and a practical guide to bash commands needed to configure the machine according to the project's parameters. 
- 💚💛 The guide is in Portuguese-BR, because I believe there is still little specific material on the subject in this language, and can be accessed by [clicking here](https://pin3dev.gitbook.io/projetos/).

✌️I hope you enjoy!!
